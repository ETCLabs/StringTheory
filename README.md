StringTheory is a simple free, open-source tool to send and recieve string data over a variety of methods and formats, to test interaction of strings in lighting control products. It is provided by ETC Inc without any warranty, in the hope that it is a useful tool.

# Supported Platforms
StringTheory supports Windows (Win 7/Win 10) and MacOS.

# Installation
An installer for the application is coming soon!

# Building
If you are interested in building the application you will need the following:

* Qt Library and Creator - https://www.qt.io/ide/
* To build the windows installer - NSIS - http://nsis.sourceforge.net/
	* If NSIS is included in your $PATH the installer will be built automatically

There is a plugin system to add additional string transports and functions
